        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of Fruits</h3>
<ol>
    <li><h4>Fructose from fruits is not harmful</h4>
        Fructose becomes harmful only in excessive amounts.
         Itâ€™s very unlikely to consume harmful levels of fructose just by eating fruit.
    </li><hr>
    <li><h4>High in fiber and water, slow to digest</h4>
        Fruits are rich in dietary fiber and water. They require time to chew and digest,
         which slows down sugar absorption and helps the body manage it safely.
    </li><hr>
    <li><h4>Excellent source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants</h4>
        Fruits provide essential nutrients like vitamin C, potassium,
         folic acid, and antioxidants. They also help reduce cholesterol and slow down carbohydrate absorption.
    </li> <hr>   
    <li><h4>May reduce the risk of chronic diseases</h4>
        Regular fruit intake is linked to lower risks of heart disease and diabetes.
         This could also be due to the healthier lifestyle often associated with fruit eaters.
    </li><hr>  
    <li><h4>Helps with satiety and weight loss</h4>
        Fruits like apples and oranges are very filling -even more than eggs-
        so they help reduce overall food intake and can contribute to long-term weight loss.
